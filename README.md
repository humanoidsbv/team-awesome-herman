# Team Awesome Herman

Team Awesome was created as practice project for the Humanoids Front-end Crash Course. It is a time management web application for Humanoids developers and UX designers, meant to keep track of their worked hours.

## Example

## Installation

```bash
# Run a development version on your localhost
npm run dev

# Run Jest tests
npm run test

# Run Storybook
npm run storybook
```

## Usage

The two main features on Team Awesome are:

- the ability to add time entries on the landing page (Timesheets)
- the ability to add new team members on the Team members page.

Press the green button in the top right of the subheader to add a new entry or a team member. The new item will render on the main page, behind the dialog. Click the cancel button or the close icon (top right) to close the dialog. On the time entries page, entries can be filtered by client, using a dropdown menu located top right, above the entries. Time entries can also be removed by clicking the bin icon. On the team members page, members can be sorted by different values, such as name or starting date.

## Technology

The follow technologies were used:

- NextJS
- React
- TypeScript - for reducing the chance of making mistakes
- Styled components - for scoped styling
- NPM - for installation of packages
- ESLint - for conventional JavaScript formatting
- Prettier - for making the code easier to read
- Jest - for testing purposes
- Vercel - for deploying and hosting our code
- Storybook - for sharing our component designs
