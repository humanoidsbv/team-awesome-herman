# Team Awesome Herman

Team Awesome was created as practice project for the Humanoids Front-end Crash Course. It is a time management web application for Humanoids developers and UX designers, meant to keep track of their worked hours.

## Usage

The two main features on Team Awesome are the ability to add time entries on the landing page (Timesheets) and new team members on the Team members page. Press the green button in the top right of the subheader to add a new entry or a team member. The new item will render on the main page, behind the dialog. Click the cancel button or the close icon (top right) to close the dialog. On the time entries page, entries can be filtered by client, using a dropdown menu located top right, above the entries. Time entries can also be removed by clicking the bin icon. On the team members page, members can be sorted by different values, such as name or starting date.

- TypeScript
- React
- NextJS
